HOUSTON A large blaze at a warehouse complex in Houston on Thursday caused explosions, prompted fears that hazardous materials had been released in the air and forced the evacuation of hundreds of students from a nearby elementary school.
Houston Fire Department spokesman Ruy Lozano says investigators are waiting to speak with the property owners so they can help identify the products that burned, but officials think pesticides might have been involved. Lozano also mentioned that another product was a petroleum based solvent.
